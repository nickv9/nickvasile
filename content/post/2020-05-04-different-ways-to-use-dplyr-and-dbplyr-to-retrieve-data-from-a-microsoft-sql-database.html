<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I use R to extract data held in Microsoft SQL Server databases on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When I first started I was confused by all the different ways to accomplish this task. I was a bit overwhelmed trying to choose the, “best,” option given the specific job at hand.</p>
<p>I want to share what approaches I’ve landed on to help others who may want a simple list of options to get started with.</p>
</div>
<div id="scope" class="section level2">
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This post is about reading data from a database, not writing to one.</p>
<p>I prefer to use packages in the tidyverse so I’ll focus on those packages.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to generalize many of the concepts I write about here to other DBMS systems I will be focused exclusively on Microsoft SQL Server. I hope this will provide simple, prescriptive guidance for those working in a similar configuration.</p>
<p>Many people working in an enterprise environment are probably working from machines joined to a Windows domain so my examples will be tailored to that configuration. That introduces a couple implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>I won’t be demonstrating how to connect from a system not joined to a Windows domain - the documentation for <code>DBI::dbConnect</code> covers that well if needed.</li>
<li>I’m not writing this content from a machine that is joined to a Windows domain, and I haven’t populated a Microsoft SQL database with the data I use in my examples, so for now, the results of the code won’t be shown in examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing - these are a few options I populated my toolbox with. They have served me well over the past two years as an analyst in an enterprise environment, but are definitely not the only options available.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Use dplyr syntax and let dbplyr handle the rest</h2>
<div id="when-i-use-this-option" class="section level3">
<h3>When I use this option</h3>
<p>This is my default option. I do almost all of my analysis in R and this avoids fragmenting my work and thoughts across different tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(
      odbc::odbc(),
      Driver = &quot;SQL Server&quot;,
      Server = &quot;your_servers_host_name&quot;,
      Database = &quot;name_of_database_you_want_to_query&quot;
   )

# Example 1: filter rows, and retrieve selected columns
dplyr::tbl(con, &quot;People&quot;) %&gt;% #People is the table
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(email), department == &quot;Purchasing&quot; ) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::select(email, first_name, last_name) %&gt;% 
  # I will remove the following line if exploring the data and
  # not interested in actually retrieving all records
  dplyr::collect() 

# Example 2: join across tables and retrieve selected columns
dplyr::tbl(con, &quot;People&quot;) %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(email, first_name, last_name, company_id ) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::left_join( #dplyr can join database tables 
    dplyr::tbl(con, &quot;Companies&quot;) %&gt;% 
      #Just get the company name, and the attribute
      # needed to join to People (Id)
      dplyr::select(id, account_name = name),
    by = c(&quot;company_id&quot; = &quot;id&quot;)
    ) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::collect()

# Example 3: Summarize and count
dplyr::tbl(con, &quot;Companies&quot;) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::filter(country == &quot;United States&quot;) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::group_by(state) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::summarise(companies = n()) %&gt;% #n() is similiar to SQL count
  # arrange in descending order by number of records in a
  # given state
  dplyr::arrange(desc(companies)) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::collect()</code></pre>

<h2>Option 2: Write SQL syntax and have dplyr and dbplyr run the query</h2>
<div id="when-i-use-this-option-1" class="section level3">
<h3>When I use this option</h3>
<p>I use this option when I am reusing a <em>fairly short</em>, existing SQL query
with minor modifications.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Example 1: Simple selection of records using SQL syntax
query &lt;- &quot;Select Id, name, billing_country, billing_state FROM
          Companies&quot;

dplyr::tbl(con, dplyr::sql(query)) %&gt;% 
  head(10) %&gt;% #limit for speed during demo
  dplyr:collect()

# Example 2: Use dplyr syntax to enhance a raw SQL query
dplyr::tbl(con, dplyr::sql(query)) %&gt;% #reuse query from previous example
  # add a filter state on top of the raw sql statement
  dplyr::filter(billing_country == &quot;United States&quot;) %&gt;%  
  head(10) %&gt;%  #limit results for speed in demo
  collect()</code></pre>

<h2>Option 3: Store the SQL query in a text file and have dplyr and dbplyr run the query</h2>
<div id="when-i-use-this-option-2" class="section level3">
<h3>When I use this option</h3>
<p>I use this approach under the following conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I’m reusing existing SQL code</li>
<li>The SQL code is longer than a line or two</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer to, “modularize,” my R code and having an extremely long SQL statement
in my R code doesn’t abstract away the complexity of the SQL query. Putting the
query into it’s own file helps achieve my desired level of abstraction.</p>
<p>In conjunction with source control it makes tracking changes to the definition of a
data set simple.</p>
<p><strong>Even more importantly, it’s a really useful way to collaborate with others who
are comfortable with SQL but don’t use R.</strong> For example, I recently used this
approach on a project involving aggregation of multiple data sets.
Another team member focused on building out the data collection logic for
some of the data sets in SQL. Once he had them built and validated he handed off
the query to me and I pasted it into a text file.</p>
<p>Step 1: Put your SQL code into a text file</p>
<p>Here is some example SQL code that might be in a file</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>SELECT p.*, a.*
  FROM People p
  LEFT JOIN Companies c ON p.company_id = c.id
  WHERE c.state == &quot;FL&quot; AND p.role = &quot;Purchasing&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say that SQL code was stored in a text file called, <code>people.sql</code></p>
<p>Step 2: Use the SQL code in the file to retrieve data and execute the query.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46105261/7416441 
query &lt;- readr::read_file(&quot;people.sql&quot;) 

dplyr::tbl(con, dplyr::sql(query))</code></pre>
