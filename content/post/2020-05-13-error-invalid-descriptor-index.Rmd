**This post is a work in progress**

## Motivation

I use the dbplyr, dplyr, DBI and odbc R packages to extract data held in Microsoft SQL Server databases on a daily basis. 

I run into the, "Invalid Descriptor Index," error documented [here](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/issues/309) constantly. It was awful! I spent so much time trying to find the, "problem," columns in tables that often had over 100 columns. I spent so many hours trying to get my queries to work which significantly took away from the time I had available to transform and analyze my data.

Through the work of many great people sharing their expertise on GitHub, I was able to identify [a workaround that worked well for me](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/issues/309#issuecomment-615255613).

The workaround helped *me* continue my daily work but did nothing to prevent others from encountering the same issue in the future. One of the great things about R is the community and I would like to do my part to help others. That might involve making a code change in a package or component involved.

I don't yet have a firm grasp on what, from a technical standpoint, leads to the failure but I do know multiple things are involved - specifically multiple R packages, ODBC drivers and Microsoft SQL Server.

I am comfortable as an R user and debugging C++ code individually but have not spent much time debugging multi-component issues in R. 

This investigation is an opportunity for me:

* Advance my R debugging skills
* Understand, at a deep level, what the failure is that leads to this error. With that understanding I will be a much better position to propose, evaluate and contribute to solutions.
