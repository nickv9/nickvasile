```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

## I'm lazy

And so are most people.

I like to focus on as few things as possible at any given moment and correlation tables get in the way of that.

## Correlation tables contain useless data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
corrs <- cor(mtcars)

corrplot::corrplot(corrs, order = "hclust")
```

![](/images/correlation_table_duh.png)

I don't need to be reminded that each predictor is perfectly correlated with itself.

I guess this could be useful because it warns me that I am about to see the same exact information for the second time.

Which brings me to...

## Correlation tables duplicate information

## A solution part 1: Eliminate the obvious

After taking a quick look at the table (just the first half :) )to get an idea as to the largest correlation values I establish a cut-off point to look at the pairs with the strongest values.

While I am at it I remove values for a predictor correlated with itself.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

cut_off <- 0.8

corrs <- cor(mtcars)

# probably *shouldn't* be using melt() here b/c reshape2 is depreciated but it 
# is easy and I like easy because I am lazy
correlated <- reshape2::melt(corrs) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(value > cut_off,
           #remove entries for a variable correlated to itself
           Var1 != Var2) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(desc(value)) #not necessary just sorting to demo pairwise dups

correlated
```

Notice each successive pair of rows is a pairwise duplicate.

## A solution part 2: Eliminate the duplicates
```{r}

correlated %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
        combo = dplyr::if_else(
            # > and < comparison doesnt work with factors so convert to char
            as.character(Var1) > as.character(Var2), #if
                               stringr::str_c(Var1, Var2), #then 
                               stringr::str_c(Var2, Var1) #else
        )
    ) %>% 
    dplyr::distinct(combo, .keep_all= TRUE) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-combo)
```

I arrived at this solution after finding this ![stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25595218)
