## I'm lazy

And so are most people.

I like to focus on as few things as possible at any given moment and correlation tables get in the way of that.

## Correlation tables contain useless data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
corrs <- cor(mtcars)

corrplot::corrplot(corrs, order = "hclust")
```

![](/images/correlation_table_duh.png)

I don't need to be reminded that each predictor is perfectly correlated with itself.

I guess this could be useful because it warns me that I am about to see the same exact information for the second time.

Which brings me to...

## Correlation tables duplicate information

![](/images/correlation_table_repeat.png)

## My solution

After taking a quick look at the table (just the first half :smile: ) to get an ideas

```{r, eval = FALSE}
correlated <- reshape2::melt(glass_corr) %>% 
    filter(value > cut_off,
           #remove entries for a variable correlated to itself
           Var1 != Var2) %>% 
    arrange(desc(value)) #not necessary just sorting to easily see pairwise dups
```
