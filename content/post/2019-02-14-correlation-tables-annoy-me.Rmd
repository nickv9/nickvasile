## I'm lazy

And so are most people.

I like to focus on as few things as possible at any given moment and correlation tables get in the way of that.

## Correlation tables contain useless data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
corrs <- cor(mtcars)

corrplot::corrplot(corrs, order = "hclust")
```

![](/images/correlation_table_duh.png)

Why do I need to be reminded that each predictor is perfectly correlated with itself?

I guess these data points are useful because they warn me that I am about to see information for the second time.

Which brings me to...

## Correlation tables duplicate information
